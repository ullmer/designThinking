Automated Boundary Spanning Agents for Multi-Cultural Distributed Multi-Team Systems
Often for many tasks different teams need to collaborate with each other. A boundary agent who is a member of the team is responsible for communicating with the other teams. The boundary agent experience isolation from their own team leading to team-breakdown. Moreover, the teams could be mono-cultural within themselves but be culturally different from each other leading to a mis-match in expectation and deliverables. Our project aims to solve this problem by introducing an AI agent as the boundary agent. The AI agent being responsible for cross-team information transmission whilst considering cultural aspects of each team and translating the message accordingly when required.

Investigating Canvas: Centralizing & Personalizing Data
As of now, hundreds of students across college campuses use Canvas for a teaching and learning software. However, there is an apparent lack of uniformity across classes within Canvas's current design leading to disorganization and inaccessibility across classes. While it is possible for the university to enforce stricter guidelines on professors to make more accessible and uniform class interfaces, it is often a tedious and taxing task for professors to do this. Our solution is to create a centralized interface for students to view important information for their classes in a more uniformed and accessible place. By designing and making this system available to students from STEM and non-STEM backgrounds we aim to make a customizable interface, through widgets and layouts, which we hope will enhance efficiency and productivity for students while reducing overall perceived stress. The methods we'll employ include short semi-structured interviews before designing and split testing (A/B testing) post design, which we'll use a within-subjects experimental design approach along with surveys to measure perceived stress and system usability amongst students.

Fair Hiring: Ethics and Transparency by Design in AI-Driven Recruitment
My project examines bias in artificial intelligence (AI) during job recruitment and its impact on job seekers. The use of AI often exacerbates bias due to data limitations and lack of transparency, making it difficult for candidates to understand the decision-making process. Many companies use AI algorithms trained on historical recruitment data, which can contain biases related to gender bias, resulting in systems that disproportionately favor females and negatively affect to female job seekers' confidence. To address these issues, the project will explore solutions for fairer AI-driven recruitment, including stronger regulation, transparency measures, ethical guidelines, and improved algorithmic models to reduce discrimination, promote diversity, and rebuild trust in AI-based hiring.

Automated Boundary Spanning Agents for Cross Cultural Multi-Team Systems
Computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) made possible global teaming with distributed
geographies. Multiple teams are expected to work together whilst being geographically distributed.
Amongst others, one problem is cultural and societal differences around work, ethics, and dialogue.
Another problem is isolation experienced by team members whose role is to mediate communication
between the teams. Whilst this team role is important, their job requires them to be sufficiently detached
from their team, which causes them to lose a sense of team identity and belonging. Such issues are
caused by putting human agents in positions given the boundary activities. We envision addressing this
by 1. replacing the boundary team member with an AI agent capable of the three types of boundary
activities: Boundary Spanning (Active), Boundary Buffering (Active), and Boundary Reinforcement
(Passive). 2. providing the agent the capability of understanding cultural cues of a particular team and
translating it to the other team.

AI and Societal Bias: Towards a Fairer and Inclusive Digital Environment
Our project investigates the impact of bias in artificial intelligence on various social groups, focusing on how AI algorithms in sectors such as recruitment, social media, education, justice, finance, and healthcare make decisions based on user data like age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. These algorithms often amplify existing societal biases, exacerbating inequalities. To address these challenges, we will explore solutions such as increasing algorithmic transparency, implementing stricter oversight, and developing more inclusive models. The ultimate goal is to foster a fairer and more transparent digital environment that reduces AI's negative effects on marginalized groups and strengthens public trust in AI systems.

For Drew and my project, we intend to produce an interface where patients and doctors can view and discuss the patient’s genetic information. The information would be gathered from a sequencing of the patient’s DNA to determine indicators for cancer and other serious illnesses that would require additional screening or preventative care. We envision an interface that would be used in the doctor’s office during consultation, but also accessible from the patient’s home. The key functions we seek to implement are genetic information retrieval, information display to patient and doctor, lifetime storage of the information and transmission of that information to only those recipients who have been authorized by the patient.

Our project will involve researching AI and VR technologies, understanding the specific needs of students with disabilities, and designing a prototype for a wearable device. The goal is to conceptualize a device that can provide real-time assistance, personalized learning, and health monitoring to support these students effectively. As one application of such a device, one can consider a high school student with a visual impairment that makes it difficult to access printed class materials. With an AI-powered wearable, this student could receive real-time audio descriptions of the materials, whether written or visual content.

Sympathy in Design: Lessons from Frankenstein
"Frankenstein" just reminds me of the debate on superalignment and effective accelerationism(e/acc) 
in today's AI development. Victor's ambition for power and control fuels his knowledge. 
Similarly, e/acc sees technological acceleration as a way to surpass human limitations, occasionally 
ignoring the dangers in favor of the benefits and advancements that come from pushing the envelope. 
In "Frankenstein," Victor is undoubtedly a failure—which is what happens when creators fail to 
anticipate the emotional, moral, and social needs of their creations. Today’s AI community faces 
a similar risk: the systems we build could develop capabilities beyond our control or understanding, 
without a framework to align them with human well-being. If I were to sum up Victor's failure as a creator, 
I would attribute it to his inability to sympathize with his work, which led to a tragic ending. 
Our voice assistant's privacy policy, on the other hand, places a strong emphasis on technology that 
is sensitive to and inclusive of human needs and feelings. Our effort bridges an often-overlooked gap 
in inclusivity and user experience by making the privacy policy accessible, particularly for visually 
impaired users. This ensures that technology serves actual human needs rather than just advancing for its own sake.

Investigating Canvas: Centralizing & Personalizing Data
As of now, hundreds of students across college campuses use Canvas for a teaching and learning software. However, there is an apparent lack of uniformity across classes within Canvas's current design leading to disorganization and inaccessibility across classes. While it is possible for the university to enforce stricter guidelines on professors to make more accessible and uniform class interfaces, it is often a tedious and taxing task for professors to do this. Our solution is to create a centralized interface for students to view important information for their classes in a more uniformed and accessible place. By designing and making this system available to students from STEM and non-STEM backgrounds we aim to make a customizable interface, through widgets and layouts, which we hope will enhance efficiency and productivity for students while reducing overall perceived stress. The methods we'll employ include short semi-structured interviews before designing and split testing (A/B testing) post design, which we'll use a

Hand Gesture Recognition for Smart Phone Interaction
Our project focuses on controlling smart devices (phone and ipads) through custom gestures, addressing the issue of not being able to use touchscreens in certain situations (such as when your hands are dirty or it’s inconvenient to touch the screen).  Additionally, it discusses the limitations of gesture control and suggests that technologies such as voice control and eye-tracking can serve as complements.

Hand Gesture Recognition for Smart Phone Interaction
We aim to solve the issue of interacting with a smartphone when the user's hands are occupied, dirty, or wet, such as while eating or bathing. Currently, some smartphones already have some hand gesture functions, but due to technological limitations, these are not very user-friendly. Our goal is to identify these bottlenecks and design from an HCC perspective to make hand gesture interactions more seamless. We will conduct user tests with a prototype using simple gestures to make the technology implementation more practical. Looking ahead, wearing a watch or gloves might make the technology easier to implement, but it could also add inconvenience, users might not like it. However, using gloves that enable deaf and mute individuals to translate their gestures into speech is an excellent application. Additionally, though our project will only focus on hand gestures, by integrating voice and eye-tracking functions with hand gestures, the technology can achieve optimal efficiency.

Privacy Notice over Voice
Despite the popularity and many convenient features of Amazon Alexa, concerns about privacy risks 
to users are rising since many Alexa voice-apps (called skills) may collect user data during the 
interaction with Alexa devices. Informing users about data collection in skills is essential for 
addressing their privacy concerns. However, the constrained interfaces of Alexa pose a challenge 
to effective privacy notices, where currently Alexa users can only access privacy policies of skills 
over the Web or smartphone apps. This in particular creates a challenge for visually impaired users 
to make informed privacy decisions. In this work, we propose the concept of Privacy Notice over Voice, 
an accessible and inclusive mechanism to make users aware of the data practices of Alexa skills through 
the conversational interface: for each skill, we will generate a short and easily understandable privacy 
notice and play it to users at the beginning of the skill in voice. We plan to design and develop a tool 
to automatically generate a reference implementation of Privacy Notice over Voice through static code 
analysis and instrumentation.

Genetic Insights
We intend to produce an interface where patients and doctors can view and discuss the patient's genetic information. The information would be gathered from a sequencing of the patient's DNA to determine indicators for cancer and other serious illnesses that would require additional screening or preventative care. We envision an interface that would be used in the doctor's office during consultation, but also accessible from the patient's home. The key functions we seek to implement are genetic information retrieval, information display to patient and doctor, lifetime storage of the information and transmission of that information to only those recipients who have been authorized by the patient.
