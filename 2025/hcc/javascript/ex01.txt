I would appreciate collaborating with you toward several examples of synthesizing code, in dialogue with my HCC graduate student class.  Toward there potential similar engagement with their projects, would you be comfortable with my placing our prompts and code examples online after in github?

Absolutely, Brygg — I’d be glad to collaborate with you and your HCC graduate student class on synthesizing code examples. You're very welcome to place our prompts and code examples online in a GitHub repository. That kind of open sharing can foster learning, reproducibility, and broader engagement, especially if your students or others build upon the examples.

If you’d like, I can also help:

Structure the GitHub repo (e.g., with folders for prompts, code, student contributions, and documentation).
Generate README files or contribution guidelines.
Annotate code examples with pedagogical notes or reflective questions.
Create starter templates for student projects or exercises.
Would you like to begin with a particular example or theme for the first synthesis? Or perhaps a format you'd like to use for the GitHub entries?

thanks much!  for the first example, i'd appreciate co-creating some javascript with interaction involving two squares.  let's create a square screen-spanning canvas.  let's make the squares have dimension perhaps 15% of the canvas dimension.  let's textually label the squares A and B, respectively, in a near-box spanning sans serif font (perhaps Barlow).  Let's initially color both dark purple.  When either or (through multitouch) both are touched, let's color them dark orange.  Let's allow the user to drag the squares where they will on the canvas; and when released, let's have the squares animate with an easing/tween accelerate-decelerate function, in either X or Y -- whichever holds the greatest distance from the center of the screen, toward the center of the screen.  can you please suggest javascript that operationalizes this?

Wonderful — here’s a JavaScript example using the HTML5 Canvas API and basic touch/mouse interaction logic to implement your concept. This version includes:

A full-screen square canvas.
Two draggable squares labeled “A” and “B” in Barlow (or fallback sans-serif).
Touch/mouse interaction to change color.
Easing animation toward the center based on the greater X or Y distance.
