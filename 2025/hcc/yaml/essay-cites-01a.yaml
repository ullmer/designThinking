           During the Middle Ages Gothic cathedrals were immersive information spaces which 
           supported religious education and practice. Stained glass windows were essential 
           to their function, in which Biblical narratives had been translated by skilled medieval 
           artists into visual forms. This paper analyzes this visual phenomenon from the perspective 
           of spatial information systems and the medieval art of memory.

         This paper considers the challenges and opportunities of access to digital archival collections. 
         After the era of digitisation, collecting institutions hold vast digital treasure-troves. 
         But the techniques we use to access these collections have been fundamentally unchanged for decades. 
         Search remains the dominant access tool. This paper makes the case for the limitations of search, 
         and proposes instead the concept of “generous interfaces” for digital collections. Generous interfaces 
         offer rich, browsable views; provide evocative samples of primary content; and support an understanding 
         of context and relationships. Based on experimental work to date, the paper outlines some 
         design principles and patterns for generous archival interfaces, as well as considering challenges to their implementation.

         This paper reviews some of the visualizations employed to represent
         information during the Middle Ages. It discusses three kinds of visualizations:
         rotae, tables and trees, and considers their context and use.
