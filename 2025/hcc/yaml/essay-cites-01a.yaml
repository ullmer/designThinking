           During the Middle Ages Gothic cathedrals were immersive information spaces which 
           supported religious education and practice. Stained glass windows were essential 
           to their function, in which Biblical narratives had been translated by skilled medieval 
           artists into visual forms. This paper analyzes this visual phenomenon from the perspective 
           of spatial information systems and the medieval art of memory.

         This paper considers the challenges and opportunities of access to digital archival collections. 
         After the era of digitisation, collecting institutions hold vast digital treasure-troves. 
         But the techniques we use to access these collections have been fundamentally unchanged for decades. 
         Search remains the dominant access tool. This paper makes the case for the limitations of search, 
         and proposes instead the concept of “generous interfaces” for digital collections. Generous interfaces 
         offer rich, browsable views; provide evocative samples of primary content; and support an understanding 
         of context and relationships. Based on experimental work to date, the paper outlines some 
         design principles and patterns for generous archival interfaces, as well as considering challenges to their implementation.

        Systematic scientometric reviews, empowered by computational and visual analytic approaches, offer 
        opportunities to improve the timeliness, accessibility, and reproducibility of studies of the literature 
        of a field of research. On the other hand, effectively and adequately identifying the most representative 
        body of scholarly publications as the basis of subsequent analyses remains a common bottleneck in the 
        current practice. What can we do to reduce the risk of missing something potentially significant? How can 
        we compare different search strategies in terms of the relevance and specificity of topical areas covered? 
        In this study, we introduce a flexible and generic methodology based on a significant extension of the 
        general conceptual framework of citation indexing for delineating the literature of a research field. 
        The method, through cascading citation expansion, provides a practical connection between studies of science 
        from local and global perspectives. We demonstrate an application of the methodology to the research of 
        literature-based discovery (LBD) and compare five datasets constructed based on three use scenarios and 
        corresponding retrieval strategies, namely a query-based lexical search (one dataset), forward expansions 
        starting from a groundbreaking article of LBD (two datasets), and backward expansions starting from a recently 
        published review article by a prominent expert in LBD (two datasets). We particularly discuss the relevance of 
        areas captured by expansion processes with reference to the query-based scientometric visualization. The method 
        used in this study for comparing bibliometric datasets is applicable to comparative studies of search strategies.

         This paper reviews some of the visualizations employed to represent
         information during the Middle Ages. It discusses three kinds of visualizations:
         rotae, tables and trees, and considers their context and use.
